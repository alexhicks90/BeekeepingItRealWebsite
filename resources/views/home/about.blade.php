<h4>About:</h4>
<p>It all started for David in the spring of 2010, after ‘bumping’ into the University of Guelph’s Honey Bee Research Center’s hives during his first year of school there.  Quickly becoming fascinated with the insects, he volunteered, took a course, applied to the HBRC, and began working as a beekeeper under Paul Kelly.  Eventually, wanting to keep his own bees, David struck a deal with David Jones and began Beekeeping It Real in 2011.  During the winter of 2012, David, wanting to learn and experience more, took off for New Zealand and worked for Betta Bees, a honey bee breading program.  David now keeps the majority of his hives in Elmira and his hometown of Ayr.  In the fall of 2014, David married Colleen who has been a huge supporter of the beekeeping and has even been known to occasionally help out!  What started off as a fascination has become…somewhat of an obsession.</p>
