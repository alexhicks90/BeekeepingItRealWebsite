Honey can be sold liquid, solid (crystalized), raw, processed, creamed, in comb, blended, and can range from light to dark in colour with a wide range of flavours.  As always there are pros and cons to every choice."

There is nearly an endless list of uses for beeswax with candles, furniture finishes/polishes, cosmetics, shoe polishes, and soap making being some of the more popular outlets.  Beeswax is a naturally antibacterial, antifungal material that when burned actually clean the air around them (emitting negative ions)."

With time, pure beeswax will develop ‘bloom’ on the outside surfaces of the block/candle etc. which is a natural process and is valued by many beeswax enthusiasts.  Bloom will not affect burning or other properties, but if it does not tickle your fancy, wiping the areas with bloom with a soft bristled brush or soft cloth should return the beeswax to its pristine state."
